# Light Sensor Mirror
The main file is a [SCAD file](holder.scad) that was used to create the other .stl files.

Use the .stl files if you have a mirror as in the description, otherwise create your own .stl file using OpenSCAD

The .stl files are based on listed measures from this collection of craft mirrors from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T8Z58SF). I haven't tested if the measures are accurate. There are 3 files for mirrors of 1x1", 0.75x0.75" and 0.5x0.5" all 0.05" in thickness.

## OpenSCAD

- Download [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org). OpenSCAD is an Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Use it for parametric CAD fil generation.
- This main SCAD file uses the [Nuts 'n Bolts library from Johannes Kneer](https://github.com/JohK/nutsnbolts)
- Change the one line with the xyz configuration in the .scad file, render and export to an .stl file.
